    <description>Handlebars.js is an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris Wanstrath. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.

Checkout the official Handlebars docs site at http://www.handlebarsjs.com.</description>
    <summary>Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>NuGet Handlebars.js version 1.1.0.1 contains modified 1.0.0 version of Handlebars.JS from http://handlebarsjs.com, where support for  CommonJS and AMD loaders was removed (because it may cause many compatability issues, think make sense to include support for loaders more close to the version 1.1 of Handlebars.js... in any case, will be glad to get your feedback about that decision).
 
Note: starting from version 1.0.9 minifiled handlebars.min.js file was added. Please update your code for production environment to use this file to save more trees in the world!</releaseNotes>
